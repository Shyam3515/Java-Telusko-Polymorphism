Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance. 
Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. 
Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks.

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) language, there are two types of polymorphism as below:
Static Binding (or Compile time) Polymorphism, e.g., Method Overloading.
Dynamic Binding (or Runtime) Polymorphism, e.g., Method overriding.
